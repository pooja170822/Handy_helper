# Handy_helper


I've developed a convenient Chrome extension called "Handy Helper" designed to simplify the process of job applications. 

When applying for jobs, we all face the challenge of filling out lengthy and repetitive forms, which can become quite time-consuming, especially when applying to multiple positions. 

With Handy Helper, you can input and store all your personal and professional information in one place. This allows for quick and easy completion of job applications, saving you time and effort in the job search process.
